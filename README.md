# Adenoma-Detection-on-Colonoscopy
The project is based on a study on the rate of tubular adenoma detection on colonoscopy with patients with hep C vs non hep C patients. Our primary aim is to prove the rate of adenoma detection (column D - 1) is higher in hep C patients (Column C-1) as compared to normal patients.
